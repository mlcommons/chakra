class UniqueIdAssigner:
    """
    Assigns unique IDs to items, ensuring each item gets a distinct ID.

    This class is used to maintain a consistent and unique mapping of original
    identifiers to new unique identifiers. It's particularly useful in scenarios
    where the uniqueness of IDs across different entities or iterations needs to
    be preserved.

    Attributes:
        next_id (int): The next unique ID to be assigned.
        original_to_new_ids (Dict[int, int]): A mapping from original IDs to their
            corresponding new unique IDs. This helps in retrieving already assigned
            unique IDs and ensures the same original ID always maps to the same
            unique ID.
